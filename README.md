# fcc-qa-personal-library
 
This is a public copy of the "Personal Library" project from my private fCC projects repo. This repo is used to host the project on Heroku in order to fulfill the fCC certificate requirements. This project was formerly hosted on Replit, but is no longer accessible due to changes to Replit's free tier.
